# Arduino_calculator_with_Dijkstra-s_algo

Calculator created on Arduino Uno R3 (China), lcd 1602 (without i2c), 5x4 keyboard, 220 Ohm resistor and variable resistor to 
regulate lcd contrast. Input data protected from wrong expression. Calculator support int and float numbers, +, -, *, /, (, ). 
= - calcuate expression.
C - clear lcd.
<- (arrow left) - delete last symbol in expression.
1st string for input expression, 2nd string for answer.
Calculting iscarring out with help of Dijkstra's algorithm of railroad (translating of expression into postfix notation). 
Expression can contain 24 symbols (if symbols more, than 16 - 1st string get offset a half.
отчёт is report, приложение 1,2,3 - applications for report.
P.S. sorry for bad english.
